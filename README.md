### MIPS instruction simulator in C

This project is a C-based simulator for a subset of the MIPS 
instruction set architecture. It aims to provide a practical 
understanding of how MIPS instructions are executed at a low 
level.

How to run (using MinGW): 
    ```bash
    > gcc MIPS.c -o MIPS.exe
    > MIPS.exe 
    ```

The simulator may require an input file containing MIPS 
instructions or accept input via standard input. Refer to 
the source code for specific usage details.
